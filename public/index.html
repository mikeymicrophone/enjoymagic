        Magic is widely considered the best game in the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are several ways to play - and they stimulate many parts of your intellect as well as your aesthetic wisdom.
        <br><br>
        Finding a way to win, or an interaction that leads to advantages, is incredibly fun.  Many can enjoy this low-tech game for hours on end.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Magic doesn't have to be hard to learn, but I was totally disappointed with the lessons I could find.
        <br><br>
        So, I decided to write a short book to help people learn not only how to play -- but how to enjoy Magic cards.

          This week, I will release <i>How to Enjoy Magic Cards</i>, a $2 PDF about how to skip the annoying parts of Magic's culture and <b>wisely</b> spend your time (and money) on the fun parts.
